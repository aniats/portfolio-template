## ðŸ¤” What is Notelify?

This web app will help you stay focus on your school task. You can add all of your work inside it and when you are done with something, you can just remove it. You can also add work that is assigned to you for next week. It will keep all of it & you can always come back to see what else you need to do.

To be put in simpler words, Notelify will help you do stuff that is ***really*** important.

## âœ¨ Inspiration

We all millennials who are also students have this common problem of procrastination that gets us every time. Whenever we are about to do something productive or something related to school, we get easily distracted. Computers & Internet play a big part in distracting us. So to work on this problem, we decided to build something that helps its users to schedule their school work, to help them add all of their work once and allow them to focus on what's important.
